A tank game whereby you lose a life every time you miss.  Power slider to adjust the power of the shot and an angle slider to adjsuts the angle of the shot.  
Wind affects power of shot and enemy dies upon being hit and a new one will spawn.

Main issue that arises is that we didn't finish the user sign in
which was intended for use with the score dictionary which keeps track of players high scores
and will swap out old high scores with new ones.  

Because the sign in was incomplete the key value for the score
is null and thus there is a ctd when closing the program (as a null value is used as the key)
The intention was to save the new high score to a csv file, so that we could see the top 10 players.

Other issue:  forgot to increment score upon destorying an enemy tank.

Used a canvas for the background so that we could make use of a turtle to trace the player's shot.

Sorting of the dictionary to display the top 10 player's gave some issues, but upon some trial and error, got it to work.

<Conclusion>
Some cool features were left out due to time constraints and a few bugs persisted because of a lack of time to fix them.
